# Phase 2: Embedding and Quality Analysis

## Phase Overview

This phase implements the core AI-powered image analysis functionality using CLIP embeddings for visual similarity detection and quality metrics (BRISQUE/NIQE) for image quality assessment. This forms the foundation for intelligent duplicate detection and quality-based selection.
