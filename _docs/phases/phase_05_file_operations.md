# Phase 5: File Operations

## Phase Overview

This phase implements the actual file system operations based on user selections from the review interface. It handles copying, moving, and deleting files while preserving directory structure and metadata.

## Tasks

### File Consolidation
- [x] Copy selected images to output directory
- [x] Preserve original directory structure
- [x] Handle filename conflicts gracefully
- [x] Copy metadata and EXIF data
- [x] Support for copy vs. move operations

### Directory Management
- [x] Create output directory structure
- [x] Merge duplicate subdirectories
- [x] Maintain relative path relationships
- [x] Handle special characters in paths
- [x] Cross-platform path compatibility

### Safety and Validation
- [x] File existence validation before operations
- [x] Disk space checking
- [x] Permission verification
- [x] Rollback capability for failed operations
- [x] Progress tracking for large operations

### Error Handling
- [x] Graceful handling of file system errors
- [x] Detailed error reporting
- [x] Partial operation recovery
- [x] User confirmation for destructive actions
- [x] Logging of all file operations

## Dependencies

- Phase 4: GUI Review Interface (user selections)
- File system utilities
- Cross-platform path handling
- Progress tracking system

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Safe Operations**: No data loss during file operations
2. **Structure Preservation**: Maintain original directory organization
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle filename conflicts intelligently
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for large operations
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of file system errors
6. **Cross-Platform**: Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/core/deduplicator.py` - File consolidation methods
- `src/utils/image_utils.py` - File operation utilities
- `src/gui/tabs/scan_tab.py` - Integration with consolidation workflow

### Key Features:
- Safe file copying and moving
- Directory structure preservation
- Filename conflict resolution
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery

## Technical Details

### File Operations
- **Copy Mode**: Preserve originals, copy to destination
- **Move Mode**: Move files to destination (destructive)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Append numbers to duplicate filenames
- **Metadata Preservation**: Copy EXIF and file attributes

### Directory Structure
- **Preserve Structure**: Maintain original folder hierarchy
- **Merge Duplicates**: Combine identical subdirectories
- **Relative Paths**: Use relative paths for portability
- **Special Characters**: Handle Unicode and special characters

### Safety Measures
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Verify files exist and are accessible
- **Space Validation**: Check available disk space
- **Permission Checks**: Verify read/write permissions
- **Atomic Operations**: Use temporary files for safety

## Next Phase

Phase 6: Modular Extensions - Add optional features like face detection, image enhancement, and custom quality metrics.
