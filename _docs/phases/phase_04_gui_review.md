# Phase 4: GUI Review Interface

## Phase Overview

This phase implements the user interface for reviewing duplicate groups and making selection decisions. It provides an intuitive way to browse, compare, and select the best images from each duplicate group.

## Tasks

### Review Interface
- [x] Duplicate group browsing and navigation
- [x] Side-by-side image comparison
- [x] Image metadata display (size, dimensions, quality scores)
- [x] Group-by-group navigation controls
- [x] Bulk selection operations

### Selection Management
- [x] Individual image selection within groups
- [x] Auto-selection based on quality metrics
- [x] Clear/reset selection functionality
- [x] Selection persistence in database
- [x] Export selected images

### User Experience
- [x] Responsive image loading and display
- [x] Progress indicators for operations
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- [x] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Dependencies

- Phase 3: Duplicate Detection (duplicate groups)
- PyQt6 for GUI components
- Database for selection persistence
- Image utilities for display

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Group Navigation**: Users can browse through all duplicate groups
2. **Image Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of images in each group
3. **Selection Interface**: Clear way to select preferred images
4. **Auto-Selection**: Automatic selection based on quality metrics
5. **Persistence**: Selections are saved and can be resumed
6. **Performance**: Smooth navigation even with large image sets

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/gui/tabs/review_tab.py` - Main review interface
- `src/db/database.py` - Added selection tracking
- `src/gui/main_window.py` - Integration with main window

### Key Features:
- Group-based navigation
- Image comparison interface
- Quality-based auto-selection
- Selection persistence
- Export functionality

## Technical Details

### Interface Layout
- Left panel: Group list with summary information
- Right panel: Detailed image comparison
- Bottom panel: Action buttons and navigation

### Selection Logic
- Manual selection: User clicks to select images
- Auto-selection: Based on BRISQUE/NIQE quality scores
- Group-level operations: Select all, clear all, auto-select best

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of image thumbnails
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Efficient database queries for group data

## Next Phase

Phase 5: File Operations - Implement the actual file copying, moving, and deletion operations based on user selections.
