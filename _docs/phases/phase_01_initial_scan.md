# Phase 1: Initial Scan

## Phase Overview

This phase implements the core directory scanning and image discovery functionality. It establishes the foundation for the entire deduplication process by scanning directories, extracting image metadata, and storing information in the SQLite database.

## Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [x] Directory scanning with recursive option
- [x] Image file format detection and validation
- [x] Image metadata extraction (size, dimensions, format, etc.)
- [x] Perceptual hash calculation for quick duplicate detection
- [x] SQLite database schema and management
- [x] Progress tracking and logging

### Database Schema
- [x] Images table for storing metadata
- [x] Indexes for performance optimization
- [x] Connection management and error handling

### Image Processing
- [x] Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, WebP)
- [x] Image loading with PIL/OpenCV
- [x] Metadata extraction (EXIF, dimensions, file properties)
- [x] Perceptual hash calculation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- PIL (Pillow) for image processing
- OpenCV for image operations
- SQLite3 (built-in)
- NumPy for array operations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Directory Scanning**: Application can scan directories recursively and discover all supported image files
2. **Metadata Extraction**: All image metadata is correctly extracted and stored
3. **Database Storage**: Images and metadata are properly stored in SQLite database
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during scanning
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted or unsupported files
6. **Performance**: Efficient scanning of large directories (1000+ images)

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/utils/image_utils.py` - Image processing utilities
- `src/db/database.py` - Database management

- Metadata extraction
- Perceptual hashing
- Database persistence
- Progress tracking

## Next Phase

Phase 2: Embedding and Quality Analysis - Implement CLIP embeddings and quality metrics calculation.
